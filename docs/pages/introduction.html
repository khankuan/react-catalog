  <h2>What is React Catalog</h2>
  <p>
    React Catalog is a UI Component development tool, inspired by <a href='https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook' target='_blank'>react-storybook</a>
    and <a href='https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen' target='_blank'>react-docgen</a>,
    to help developers and designers build reusable UI Kit for their react application.
    As your application grows, the number of components will quickly grow out of hand. (As of July 2015, Facebook already has
    <a href='https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html' target='_blank'>15,000</a> components). This catalog is only concerned with
    <a href='https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0' target='_blank'>Presentational</a> components.
    The goal is to focus on pure UI design and development without worrying about the application logic (Redux, Relay, and more..).
    This documentation is also generated by the catalog (Checkout the /docs folder).
